This is a recipe for a shakshuka, Israeli style:

Slice tomatoes and roast them a bit on the pan with some olive oil, salt, paprika spice and some garlic.

Then, add eggs until tomatoes are covered.

Put a lid on top of pan and let it cook for a bit.

Slice some bread or pitas, make some tahini and here you go! A wonderful and nutritious meal.

Beteavon!
